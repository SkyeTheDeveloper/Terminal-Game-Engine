# C Game

This is just a small game I'm writing in C to learn how the language works and get more used to it. I will eventually want it to be a full game thats extremely moddable (mainly by just editing the Maps.c, Maps.h, and Game.c files) and have a full settings menu and credits screen.

If you would like to contribute to this and help make the game, look at the style guide (StyleGuide.md), write some code, add your code to the NOTICE.md, and make a pull request to contribute it.
